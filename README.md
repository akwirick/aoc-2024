# Advent of code 2024 

My goals are pretty simple.  I'm solving advent of code this year using rust and a focus on quick, efficient implementations.  Quick in this instance refers to "Aaron has a life outside of coding and so I can't burn a lot of oil on this".

Using the excellent template from [blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/rust/2024/11/29/advent-of-code-in-rust-for-the-rest-of-us/).   

## Solutions

All solutions are found in `bin/` and numbered by day.
